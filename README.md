# Snake Snack

Are you ready to help the snake grow and get some food to eat? 
Snake Snack is based on the classic Snake Game that so many people around the world have grown up with.
It is for every person that wants either a hit of nostalgia or just a fun easy game to play. It is on a full on responsive webside with multiple options to either play the game or maybe you want to learn about the reason behind the website, or get in contact. So why not give it a try, and get lost in the game, try and beat your own high score while listening to a good song in the background.
